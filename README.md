The first graph shows the duration of checkout times for the bikes. The number of rides peaks at 0 hours and about 10 minutes, which suggests that most users are not going very far with the bikes. Most trips do not last more than an hour. The second graph breaks out the trip durations by gender. As we can see, males checkout the most bikes. 

* Trips by Weekday per Hour
  
During the week, the most popular times of day to rent a bike are during rush hour, 7-9am and 5-7pm. On the weekends, the most popular time of day to rent a bike is midday. 


When we look at the trips taken by weekday per hour broken out by gender, we can see that the trends are similar for males and females. The most popular time for unknown gender is midday on the weekends. 


* Trips by User Type 
The below graph shows the number of rides broken out by User Type, Gender and Days of Week. 

It is clear from the above heat map, that subscribers make up most of the rides. For subscribers, with the exception of Wednesdays, it seems that there are more rides are taken during the week, opposed to the weekend. For regular customers, although difficult to see with the plain eye, more trips are taken on the weekends, rather than during the week. 

* Top Locations
The maps highlight the stop starting and stopping locations for bikes. The markers show the locations that had 10,000+ rides originating and ending there.
