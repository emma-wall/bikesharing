  The first graph shows the duration of checkout times for the bikes. The number of rides peaks at 0 hours and about 10 minutes, which suggests that most users are not going very far with the bikes. Most trips do not last more than an hour. The second graph breaks out the trip durations by gender. As we can see, males checkout the most bikes. 

### Trips by Weekday per Hour
  The following heat maps show the number of rides by Weekday per Hour.

  When we look at the trips taken by weekday per hour broken out by gender, we can see that the trends are similar for males and females. The most popular time for unknown gender is midday on the weekends.

  It is clear from the above heat map, that subscribers make up most of the rides. For subscribers, with the exception of Wednesdays, it seems that there are more rides are taken during the week, opposed to the weekend. For regular customers, although difficult to see with the plain eye, more trips are taken on the weekends, rather than during the week. 

### Top Locations
  The maps highlight the stop starting and stopping locations for bikes. The markers show the locations that had 10,000+ rides originating and ending there.

  If we were to zoom into the maps, we would see that many of the top starting locations are near major train stations and ferry ports within the city. 

## Summary 
  From the images we can see the following 
* Citibike is used more widely by men than women
* Citibikes are mostly used for short 10 min rides 
* A majority citibike users are commuters who use the bikes during rush hour. 
* Subscribers make up most of the business 
* The best locations for citibikes are near large train/ bus stops and ferry ports
